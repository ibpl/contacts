## :blue_heart: :tada: Why is this so awesome?

* :rocket: **Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Mail and Calendar – more to come.
* :tada: **Never forget a birthday!** You can sync birthdays and other recurring events with your Nextcloud Calendar.
* :busts_in_silhouette: **Sharing of address books!** You want to share your contacts with your friends or coworkers? No problem!
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great and open SabreDAV library.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

The app is distributed through the [app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/contacts) and you can install it [right from your Nextcloud installation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/apps_management.html).

Release tarballs are hosted at https://github.com/nextcloud-releases/contacts/releases.

## :satellite: Support

### Could you add XXX property?
> This is a complicated answer. We did not invent the way contacts works. We are following the official vCard format. This format include a predefined set of properties that other applications/devices supports too (Android, iOS, Windows, Gnome...). Adding a custom property would just make it compatible with Nextcloud and will not be understood by any other clients and make it complicated for us to ensure its sustainability over time.
Long story short, we suggest you use the Notes field to add your custom data :)
